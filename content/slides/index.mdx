## \"Static content often needs a full-rebuild to apply new changes\"

### No longer an issue thanks to:

<Steps>
  <Step>Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)</Step>
  <Step>Read-only tokens</Step>
</Steps>

---

## Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

- Feature in NextJS
- Allows your pages to be generated dynamically as-needed.

---

- Run at build-time (statically) and at run-time (serverside rendering)

---

# ISR with Tina

- At build time, generate pages from local files
- At runtime time, generate pages from Tina's content API (through GitHub)
